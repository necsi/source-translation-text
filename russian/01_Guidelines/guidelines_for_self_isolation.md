This guideline is for individuals who have tested positive
for COVID-19 but have mild or no symptoms. Mild symptoms
include low fever, mild fatigue, coughing, but without pneumonia symptoms and with no accompanying chronic illness.
Where local medical resources are strained and cannot hospitalize individuals with moderate or even worse symptoms,
this document can also provide guidance. Please keep in mind
that advice provided here is designed for mild/no symptom
individuals.
Once symptoms develop, including difficulties in breathing,
high fever, seek medical care immediately.
GENERAL
• Recognize that most cases resolve with a full return to
health. The quarantine is a temporary necessity, typically
for 14 days.
• It is strongly advised to live alone, at least in a separate
room.
IF YOU ARE LIVING ALONE
• Keep close track of your health condition. Keep a health
log with clear handwriting in an obvious place. The log
should include: record date & time, heart rate, blood
oxygen saturation (taken by oximeter), any symptoms,
meals, medicine taken and dosage.
• Keep abreast of local information on what to do when
symptoms progress. Have key contacts in speed dial. Set
up check-in (at least daily) with a family member/friends.
Inform them of all the emergency contact information, as
well as any information needed to get into your home in
case you are incapacitated.
• Take care of your health with sufficient hydration, eat
a balanced diet, and sleep regular hours. Maintain or
develop fun or educational activities including reading,
solitary or online games, or other online interactions.
• Wash your hands frequently, with soap / hand sanitizer
for no less than 20 seconds each time.
• Regular ventilation of the living area is crucial.
• Wash bed sheets, towels and clothing frequently. Separate
yours from others.
• Avoid contact with your pet and other animals. If not possible, ensure you wear mask and wash hands before/after
interacting with pets.
• Isolate yourself from any physical contact with others, but
stay in touch with family and friends by text, phone, video
chats, or other electronic means. This is important for
many reasons including maintaining a positive outlook.
• If news about the development of the outbreak gives you
anxieties, try not to focus too much on it to avoid further
mental health burden.
• Make a relatively consistent daily routine. If possible,
keep a moderate or even small amount of physical exercises.
• Coordinate with family friends, or local authorities the
logistics of delivery of essentials including daily meals.
Keep track of all essentials and be aware of the time
each will run short, anticipate and inform suppliers in
advance. No-contact drop off is best. A mask and gloves
are required whenever interacting with delivery people.
• Consult with local authorities and health care providers
about the duration and condition for ending self-isolation.
Systematically clean, wash, and launder before exiting.
Exercise caution even after the self-isolation.
• In suburban or rural areas where exiting and entering the
home is possible without contact with others, or shared
spaces, taking walks in isolation from others can be done.
Don’t forget that you are in quarantine and don’t interact
with others or go into spaces where others are likely to
be, either when you are there or later.
IF YOU SHARE LODGING WITH SOMEONE ELSE
• The people who share lodging with you are considered
"close contacts," and should follow local guideline regarding close contacts, including avoiding unnecessary
contact with others.
• The other residents in the lodging should avoid having
visitors, especially vulnerable people (seniors, or those
with chronic disease). Any visitor should be informed
about the presence of a quarantined individual.
• Clearly define, with visual aids if possible, different zones
in the residence. The bedroom and facilities used by the
patient is considered a Red Zone. Areas connected with
the Red Zone, for example the living room, are considered
Yellow Zones. Other separated rooms are Green Zones.
• The patient should strictly follow sneeze etiquette, sneezing into disposable tissues that are safely discarded, or
into clothing (e.g. sleeve) that is soon washed.
• Set up a communication mechanism in the household so
the patient can inform the other residences when he/she
has to leave the their room.
• The patient should disinfect Red Zones regularly. Other
cohabitants disinfect the Yellow Zones, and preferably
Green Zones, regularly.
• The patient should limit himself/herself to the Red Zone,
minimizing entry into Yellow Zones. Completely avoid
Green Zone. Objects in close contact with the patient
should also follow this rule. Outside the red zone, the
patient should wear gloves and a mask.
• Possible transmission routes: Shared facilities: kitchen,
bathroom, etc. Shared household supplies: towel, glasses,
utensils, etc. Shared food, beverages, etc. Surfaces
touched: door handle, table surface, remote control, light
switches, etc. These should be disinfected at least once a
day.
• Patient should clean after using any shared facility, especially the bathroom. Keep the toilet lid shut when not
being used.
• Patient should have a separate garbage bag/bin for disposing gloves, masks, tissues, etc.
• If possible, cohabitant should help to deliver take out,
packages of the patient to the door, to minimize patient’s
need to leave the Red Zone.
