Why are people so afraid of this outbreak, isn't it just like the normal flu?
The Coronavirus causes about 20% severe cases and 2% deaths. This is about 20 times higher than the flu.

A typical incubation period is 3 days but it may extend to 14 days, and reports exist of 24 and 27 days.

It is highly contagious with an increase from day to day of 50% in new cases (infection rate R0 of about 3-4) unless extraordinary interventions are made.

Take part in eradicating this epidemic
endCoronavirus.org is built and maintained by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) and collaborators.  Our goal is to minimize the impact of the Coronavirus COVID-19 by providing useful data and guidelines for action.

About us
The key to stopping the spread of the virus is to lower connectivity
Every time the virus does not infect another person, it has a massive impact on reducing the growth of overall infections. The better informed we all are on the actions we can take, the better we will serve our most vulnerable loved ones and our healthcare infrastructure at large.

Without intervention, it is estimated that an individual with the virus will infect on average 3-4 other people, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of cases over time. If social connectivity can be lowered such that the average number of people that an individual with the virus infects is less than one other person, the number of cases will exponentially decrease over time instead.

Stay informed with the latest news on preventing and defeating the spread of COVID-19, written and published by experts in the field.
