Obtaining and providing essentials at a time of crisis requires extraordinary attention. We provide a list of actions
supermarkets, grocery stores and pharmacies can take to
prevent the spread of the Coronavirus.
• Store workers who suspect they might have Coronavirus,
or exhibit flu-like symptoms, should not go to work.
• Reduce crowding. Decrease the number of customers
allowed in the store at a time. Maximum occupancy
depends on the size of the store, as well as the number
of customers the store serves daily.
• If customers have to wait in line, lines should form
outside in open air, if possible, and the spacing between
customers should be at least 2 meters / 6 ft. Stores
can place markings on the ground to help customers
understand where to line-up.
• For stores with a large parking lot, and create a queue
by asking customers for their phone numbers and either
calling or texting them to indicate that it is their turn to
shop. Alternatively, the customers can take a number and
the store can use a display / speaker to communicate
• Customers should be encouraged to shop online and
provide for pickup (outdoors if possible) or delivery.
• Signs should be posted to caution customers and workers
about entering with symptoms. For those customers, if not
more generally, systems should be in place for ordering
by phone or online and drive by pickup or delivery.
• The external body temperatures of the workers, as well
as the customers, should be measured, if possible. If a
person shows a high temperature (101◦F, or 38◦C), they
should not be allowed into the store.
• Stores that serve many customers should maximize their
space by expanding to other areas. For example, a tent in
a parking lot, or adjacent store space.
• Organize the store so commonly purchased and high
volume items are easy to access. For example, by a single
route around the periphery rather than through the aisles.
• Consider setting up one or more “necessities only” sections that enable a short shopping trip for most of the
customers. Setting up such short shopping areas outside
when weather permits, or at remote locations, can dramatically reduce the shopping density inside the store.
• Use floor markings or other visual system to indicate a
one-way loop (with short cuts, but no back way) inside
the store to promote a dominant walking direction and
avoid customers crossing paths or crowding.
• Stores should work with their communities to make sure
store visits are well spread out in time (and for community mutual help in shopping for those with symptoms
or at risk). There should be a roughly constant flow of
people visiting the store at any given time.
• Arrange the first hour for elderly or high risk customers
with even lower density restrictions (even better for
community mutual help to provide no-contact delivery).
• Customers should be reminded that they should not
buy more supplies than necessary. We suggest that each
individual has two weeks worth of food and goods at any
point in time.
• Stores should have hand sanitizer at the entrances and
exits of the store, as well as several locations within the
store. These sanitizing stations should be accompanied
by signs which remind the customers to use the sanitizer,
touch as few things as possible in the store, and to avoid
touching their faces.
• Store workers should minimize their physical interactions
with customers as much as possible, and they should also
make sure customers keep space between each other.
• For stores that serve a small number of people, have
the customers wait outside, take orders, and have the
groceries handed off outside. This is the ideal solution,
we understand it is not possible for many stores.
• It is recommended that store workers wear face masks.
Customers should wear masks where supply is adequate.
Wearing plastic gloves is also suggested. Workers should
avoid touching their face even when wearing gloves, and
the gloves should be thrown away and replaced regularly,
or after touching a surface which is suspected to be
compromised by the virus.
• Store workers responsible for stocking the shelves should
take extreme care in making sure everything is clean and
sanitary. Since they touch and breathe on almost all of the
goods, they could potentially spread the virus throughout
the community. Gloves and masks are essential.
• Checkout should be arranged for minimal contact without
waiting in lines or proximity between customers or customers and cashiers and baggers. Cashiers and baggers
should wear gloves or use sanitizer frequently. Arrange
for self-checkout where possible. Promote electronic payments and avoid cash payments where possible.
• Store workers should make sure to thoroughly clean
themselves and all surfaces in the store after every shift.
• Cleaning throughout the store should be performed constantly, if possible. If this is not possible, the store
managers should set a cleaning schedule which is as
frequent as possible. At minimum, store workers should
clean every shopping cart or basket after every use.
• Store managers should have daily meetings (maintaining
distance) that address any issues of cleanliness or interactions that have occurred and provide solutions to be
implemented going forward.
• Customers, store workers, and store managers should be
open to communicating with each other to help improve
the shopping experience, with an emphasis on the safety
of the community.
• Employers should anticipate worker shortages and expand
the worker pool.
