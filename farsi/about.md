#درباره ما:

سایت endCoronavirus.org  توسط موسسه سیستم‌های پیچیده نیوانگلند (NECSI) و همکاران ساخته و مدیریت می‌شود.
هدف ما کمینه کردن آسیب‌های ناشی از ویروس کوید-19 باارایه اطلاعات مفید و راهکارهای عملی است.  

تیم تحقیقاتی ما شامل اساتید، دانشجویان و سایر افراد وابسته از دانشگاهای ام‌آی‌تی، هاروارد، برندیس و دیگر دانشگاهان ملی و بین‌المللی است. ما در حال بررسی شبانه‌روزی و اطلاغ‌رسانی وضعیت فعلی همه‌گیری (اپیدمی) کوید-19 هستیم.

We employ a range of mathematical tools designed for systems with many interacting components in which traditional statistical assumptions break down.

We specialize in networks, agent-based modeling, multi-scale analysis, and complexity, and have applied our approaches to evolution, ecology, biodiversity, altruism, systems biology, cellular response, health care, systems engineering, negotiation, military conflict, ethnic violence, and international development.
Call to Action

COVID-19 is a rapidly transmitting disease that evolves in 20% of cases to require extended hospitalizations and roughly 2-4% of cases result in death, with risks increasing rapidly for those over 50 years old. It can transmit even with mild symptoms (coughing, sneezing, or elevated temperature) and perhaps before symptoms appear. Reducing the likelihood of transmission requires everyone to reduce their likelihood of contact not only so they aren’t infected but also so that they don’t transmit the disease to others.

If everyone got tested for COVID-19, we could temporarily separate the infected from the uninfected. This would help reduce the spread of the virus and allow for societies to function normally. For these reasons, universal testing is our highest priority.

Aggressive and bold actions are required to reduce transmission by minimizing close-contact interaction in order to reduce vulnerability and risk for individuals, but also to “get ahead” of the outbreak so that it is stopped.

Everyone can help.
