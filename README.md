# Source translated text for endcoronavirus.org

(for web v2)

## Useful info to get started

We use plain text (markdown), one can paste own trasnlation from any source.

- [Markdown Reference](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Each language has a directory

Files can be

1.  added, edited in place via web browser or via git
2.  GUI or
3.  command line.

The easiest option is (1.). Once a file is edited, the commit message (just below the editing window) can include both language and changelog
The [changelog](changelog.md) is maintained also separately in the root directory of the repo

Editors are used as collaborators. Each editor works **only** on his/her own directory, not touching the rest (otherwise we need a more complex procedure, which we don't want now

## Workflow

- once collaborator (talk to [Paul](paulghaddad) or [Angelo](aprossi) look for your language directory.
- edit the files from the web interface and put the content
- publish your changes using Pull Request (PR in short). Add meaningful commit messages and a branch name. If you commit half-way before ending a changelog entry, state it in the commit message (e.g. `started working on new About page`)
- once one of the formal changes is applied to your language, please document it (e.g. `changelog 20 Italian`)

Here's an example using russian language:
