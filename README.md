# Source translated text for encoronavirus.org

## Useful info to get started 

We use plain text (markdown), one can paste own trasnlation from any source. 

* [Markdown Reference](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Each language has a directory

Files can be 
 1. added, edited in place via web browser or via git 
 2. GUI or 
 3. command line.
 
The easiest option is (1.). Once a file is edited, the commit message (just below the editing window) can include both language and changelog 
The changelog is maintained also separately in the root directory of the repo

Editors are used as collaborators. Each editor works **only** on his/her own directory, not touching the rest (otherwise we need a more complex procedure, which we don't want now

## Workflow
* once collaborator (talk to [Paul](paulghaddad) look for your language directory.
* Edit the files from the web interface and put the content 
* Add meaningful commit messages. if you commit half-way before ending a changelog entry, state it in the commit message (e.g. ```started working on new About page```
* Once one of the formal changes is applied to your language, please document it (e.g. ```changelog 20 Italian```)
