**Our Slack**
We use Slack as a communication tool to help organize our projects.

Once you join our Slack workspace, you’ll be presented with introductory material which helps you get started by familiarizing you with our ongoing projects. Each project will have a specific channel which you can join, and each channel will have a pinned introductory document located near the top of the screen which will get you up to speed. If you have a specific project you would like to work on, see if there is already a group working on this project. If it is not already being done, you can start a channel and build a team to help! Having a collection of 4,000+ individuals which includes experts in many fields, the potential for impact is huge.

To help navigate the Slack workspace, our channels have been categorized using the prefixes listed below. In Slack, you can find these by searching “#prefix” with the prefix which you are interested in. To view all channels, you can click on “Channels” on the left-hand side of the screen.

general- (general channels for everyone / basic organizational processes/ strategic alignment)

analytics- (analytics, data, visualization, mapping)

com- (communications / community relations)

link- (common channels with other organizations/ projects/ partners)

outreach- (efforts focused on outreach to individuals or communities)

response- (efforts to help with the on the ground response efforts, including medical)

For example, #outreach-africa is a channel which focuses on providing information to individuals, communities, and governments in Africa. #general-help-wanted is a channel for both offering or asking for help with a project.

If you see a particular channel that seems the best fit for you, please feel free to reach out and offer your support. The more you share in how you can contribute, the better we can get you on a task. Each team leader will look to point you in the right direction based on this.

This is a self-organizing team! Have a look around and get a feel for what skills you bring to the table and where people need help. If you are keen on starting your own project you can do that too!
