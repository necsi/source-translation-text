\*\* Making Masks

Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of patients with COVID 19, with symptoms ranging from mild to serious, as well as their normal urgent care and emergency patients. Medical supplies to care for patients and to protect medical providers, their families and patients are running short throughout the country. While not ideal, reusable washable masks can be made by hand, and they area needed for protection in hospitals, nursing homes, rehab centers, group homes and other group settings.

There are a number of Facebook groups coordinating this effort and working with local health care facilities regarding requirements and drop off of masks. Two have just merged and are working together: RosieSews.org / Million Mask Mayday - Make Masks & More to Fight COVID-19

Here are the basic materials and supplies you’ll need.

Different types of masks are good for different uses.

Video instructions can be mixed and matched, depending on need and sewing skills.

There are dozens of videos and patterns/ instructions on line for making masks. We have chosen a few here that are simple, for beginners, and for different learning styles.

Mask with elastic and pocket for filter

Mask with elastic ear loops, multiple layers of fabric for better safety, no pocket for filter.

Two layer cotton mask, cloth loops, using hand made bias tape. Easier to purchase premade bias tape.

Written instructions made by a nurse. It is a slightly more complicated pattern, but still easy to make. No elastic, bias tape ties.
